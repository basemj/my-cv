Accessibility and browser compatibility were very important to this client due to the nature of its target audience which meant that fall-backs were always put in place for new features and thorough testing was done before any deployment. As the front end lead, I was in charge of planning the structure and setting up the Sitecore page layouts, sub-layouts and what we called “blocks” for this very flexible site. The blocks can be setup differently and placed within the homepage or any other page, including the e-commerce and checkout process pages. This also applies to the Sitecore modules used on the site such as the web forms for marketer’s module styled to fit anywhere the client wished. Along with this flexibility came the risk of site editors making mistakes so I was in char the Sitecore security setup on the solution based on inheritance of roles and domains for the microsites within the setup."
